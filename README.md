Behind the Scenes of our Great Smart India Hackathon Project.
Although, we may not win, but we have to make this project work, trust me guys. This is an industrial project. It's our golden chance to develop one good project and use it in our resume.
So let's help each other, learn with each other, and let's make this project a great success.

We all are very new to each other. Maybe editing these files and the concepts in games will connect us.



# README.md

This `README.md` file provides comprehensive documentation for the project, which focuses on the development of an educational web-based and mobile-based game on groundwater conservation and management.

## 1. Introduction and Overview
This project aims to create an interactive and fun game designed to teach the nuances of groundwater conservation.
