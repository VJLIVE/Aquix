Behind the Scenes of our Great Smart India Hackathon Project.
Although, we may not win, but we have to make this project work, trust me guys. This is an industrial project. It's our golden chance to develop one good project and use it in our resume.
So let's help each other, learn with each other, and let's make this project a great success.

We all are very new to each other. Maybe editing these files and the concepts in games will connect us.



# README.md

This `README.md` file provides comprehensive documentation for the project, which focuses on the development of an educational web-based and mobile-based game on groundwater conservation and management.

## 1. Introduction and Overview
This project aims to create an interactive and fun game designed to teach the nuances of groundwater conservation. Targeting school kids, youth, and water enthusiasts, the game integrates real-world scenarios such as drought, surplus rain, and contamination, allowing players to learn good practices in groundwater management while earning points based on their decisions. The game’s objective is to raise awareness and educate players on critical environmental issues through engaging gameplay.

## 2. Usage Guide
The usage guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to access, navigate, and play the game. It will cover the basic game mechanics, how to earn points, and the significance of each decision made within the game. Additionally, it will explain how players can track their scores online and strive to become water-smart certified youths.

## 3. Project Structure
This section provides an overview of the project's structure, detailing the organization of files and directories. It explains the purpose of key components, such as the game engine, user interface, backend server, and database. This guide helps new developers understand the architecture of the project and how different parts interact. Refer [#WORKFLOW.md](https://github.com/VJLIVE/Aquix/blob/main/WORKFLOW%20.md) for better understanding.

## 4. Project Status and Roadmap
The project is currently in development, with initial prototypes focusing on core gameplay and scenario implementation. The roadmap includes plans for expanding the game with additional features like multiplayer mode, advanced scoring algorithms, and more complex scenarios. Future updates will also focus on refining the user experience and optimizing performance for both web and mobile platforms.

## 5. Contribution Guidelines
The contribution guidelines outline how other developers and contributors can get involved in the project. It includes instructions for setting up the development environment, coding standards, and how to submit issues or pull requests. Contributors are encouraged to help enhance the game’s features, improve the user interface, and add new scenarios or interventions to make the game more comprehensive.
